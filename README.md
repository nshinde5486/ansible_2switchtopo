# OPS-Ansible

## What is ops-ansible?

The ops-ansible is a repository to host the Ansible OpenSwitch roles,
as well as Ansible playbook examples.  The primary goal of this repository
is to be the place for all Ansible related files/script under
[git.openswitch.net](http://git.openswitch.net/cgit/openswitch/ops-ansible).

Since all of the activity is pushed to the official Ansible
repositories, for example [Ansible galaxy](http://galaxy.ansible.com)
for OpenSwitch Ansible roles, this repository will be treated as a staging
area for that purpose.

## What is the structure of the repository?

As explained in the [OpenSwitch contribution page](http://www.openswitch.net/documents/dev/contribute-code#adding-top-level-files-and-directories),
all the roles as well as the sample playbooks will be located under the
```roles``` and ```utils``` directory, respectively:

- roles/
  - switch/
- utils/
- ops-tests/
  - components/
